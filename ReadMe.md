# Performance Tests ‚Äì UI Category & Filter Measurement

This repository contains **Playwright-based performance tests** for measuring category and filter load times on the website. The tests are designed to run **one category at a time**, focusing on the **first product load performance**.

---

## üß© Overview

The test performs the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Home page**.
2. Click a specific **category button** (e.g., Best Sellers).
3. Apply preset filters:  
   - **Sort by:** Price (low ‚Üí high)  
   - **Product Type:** All Products  
   - **Protein:** Chicken
4. Wait for the **first product** to appear.
5. Log all **timings in seconds**.
6. End with a **summary of total elapsed time** and a final `Performance test completed` message.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only **one category is measured per test** to reduce timeout issues and improve reliability.
